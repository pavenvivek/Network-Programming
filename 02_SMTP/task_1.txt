2] When trying to send to non-iu email address, the server is denying relay.

250 mail-relay.iu.edu Hello silo.soic.indiana.edu [129.79.247.5], pleased to meet you

550 5.7.1 paven.vivek@gmail.com... Relaying denied. Proper authentication required.
-----------------

It's clear from the above message that non-iu mail addresses could not be authenticated by the smtp mail server.

3] When using made-up from address, the server is working as normal without throwing error. It seems, the server is not authenticating or checking the validity of the from address.
So, the smpt protocol does not bother about the validity of the from address.
