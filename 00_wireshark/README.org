* Instructions

As explained in lecture, the protocols we are studying exchange information in
units called "packets". In this first assignment we will look at an application
called "Wireshark" which is designed with packet analysis in mind. See the
[[file:Wireshark_Intro_v7.0.pdf][Wireshark Intro v7.0]] document in the assignemnt directory. This document will
explain what the Wireshark tool is, how to download it, and how to run it on
your local machine.

Once wireshark is installed on your machine, perform the following tasks:

** Task 1 - Explore HTTP

We will be taking a closer look at the basic HTTP GET/Response
interaction. Let’s begin the exploration of HTTP by downloading a very simple
HTML file, one that is very short, and contains no embedded objects.

1. Start up your web browser.

2. Start up the Wireshark packet sniffer, as described in the Wireshark
   Intro. Enter the letters “http” in the field of the display filter. Click the
   button Apply so that only captured HTTP messages will be displayed in the
   packet list. (The only interest here is in the HTTP protocol, and you don’t
   want to see the clutter of all captured packets).

3. Begin Wireshark packet capture.

4. Enter the following to your browser:
   http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file1.html 

   Your browser should display the very simple, one-line HTML file.

5. Stop Wireshark packet capture.

The window-pane of the packet list will show that two HTTP messages were
captured: the GET message (from your browser to the /gaia.cs.umass.edu/ web
server) and the response message from the server to your browser.

The next window-pane of the packet details shows details of the selected message
(in this case the HTTP GET message, which is highlighted in the packet list).

Recall that since the HTTP message is carried inside a TCP segment, which is
carried inside an IP datagram, which is carried within an Ethernet frame,
Wireshark displays the Frame (called packet), Ethernet MAC, IP, and TCP header
information as well.  It is highly desired to minimize the amount of non-HTTP
data displayed so make sure that the boxes at the far left of the Frame,
Ethernet, IP and TCP information have a plus sign or a right-pointing triangle,
and the HTTP line has a minus sign or a down-pointing triangle (which means that
all information about the HTTP message is displayed).

Answer the following questions By inspecting and looking at the information in
the HTTP GET and response messages.

1. What is the IP address of your computer? Of the /gaia.cs.umass.edu/ server? 

2. What is the status code and phrase returned from the server to your browser?

3. What languages does your browser indicate to the server that it can accept?
   Which header line is used to indicate this information?

4. How many bytes of content (size of file) are returned to your browser? Which
   header line is used to indicate this information?

5. How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until the HTTP
   OK reply was received? (By default, the value of the Time column in the
   packet listing window is the amount of time, in seconds, since Wireshark
   tracing began.  To display the Time field in time-of-day format, select the
   Wireshark View pull down menu, then select Time Display Format, then select
   Time-of-day.)

** Task 2 - Capture a traceroute

1. Start a new packet capture in Wireshark. (Should be running as root in Linux or Macintosh)

2. Open a "terminal window" on Mac or Linux, a "Command Prompt" on Windows 
   http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window
   
3. Use the "tracert" command on Windows to determine path and intermediate
   devices between your host and yahoo.com. On Linux or Macintosh, the command
   is "traceroute". You should see results of the traceroute command in your
   terminal/command window, as well as in the wireshark packets list. For
   example:
 
   (Remember, "tracert" for Windows, "traceroute" for Linux & Macintosh!)

5. Type "icmp" into the "filter" window and then click the "apply" button to
   narrow down the types of packets shown in the list.
   
4. Stop the Wireshark trace. Packets should no longer be collected.

6. Take a screen shot of the wireshark window showing the ICMP
   packets. Depending on the number of hops between where you are on the
   Internet and Yahoo, you might not be able to fit all the ICMP packets on the
   screen. That's OK, just make the Wireshark window as "tall" as you can, and
   perhaps uncheck the "packet bytes" and "packet details" sections under the
   "View" menu. Notice the IP addresses match up to the output from the
   traceroute command in your terminal window.

7. Copy and paste the contents of the terminal window and the screen shot from
   step 6 into a document and submit.  Please be sure to type your name and
   e-mail address at the top of your document submission.
